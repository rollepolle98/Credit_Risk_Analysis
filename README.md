# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In this project I am tasked with trying multiple different undersampling techniques in order to retrive a lgistic regression. After deploying multiple different techniques, SMOTEENN and Balanced Random Forest classifier will be use to model the algorithm. The purpose of this analysis is to experiment with creating a machine learning model that would most accurately predict credit risk by applying multiple different models and looking at the analysis in order to determine which is the best fit.
